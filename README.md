# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Autoencoder and Voting Classifier!

Autoencoder anomaly detection is a technique that utilizes autoencoder neural networks to identify anomalies or outliers in a dataset. By training the autoencoder on normal data, it learns to reconstruct typical patterns. During anomaly detection, data points with reconstruction errors exceeding a threshold are flagged as anomalies. This approach is valuable for detecting anomalies without relying on labeled anomaly data, making it applicable to various data types and scenarios.
